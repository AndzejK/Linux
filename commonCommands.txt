dd if=dd_test.txt of=dd_test.someBlocks.txt // copy a whole file.

journalctl -k // reading "Initial kernel Read" logged 

du -sh * //disc usage "s" here show total, basically where you're at dir it'll display the size of usinf files/dir

## find ##
find [location] [how I want to find/option/argument]
    **find a file name
find . -name "myfile*" // start looking for a file from the current dir "." by name, casesensetive, in this case myfile and whatever afterwards;
    **find a file by modified files through "N" MINUTES ago:
                                    through "N" DAYS ago, [-mtime n]
find dir -mmin -50 // find files from "dir" directory which were modified in the last 50 min;

case #1 - When I want to find some certain files and move them to a dir.
        find . -type f -name "*.pdf" | xargs -I [] mv [] /dir // -I [] mv [] - here we have -I option where  we tell that we gonna use the placeholder
        //since "mv" command requires SC and DST, we place all outcome to placeholde [] and later provider one by one result to "mv" command
        //looks that we give source "*.pfd" and DST is always the same/constent and in our case "/dir"

        my recent usage of find it move it command:
rock@Andzejs-Air Downloads % ls -t | head -1 | xargs -I {} mv {} /Volumes/KOBOeReader/books

let's say I want to get/print just some info from "ls" command
rock@rock:~$ ls -l | awk '{print $9 "=" $5}' // where shell prints name of dir/file (9 position) separated by '=' sign and following with size of dir/file (5 position)
