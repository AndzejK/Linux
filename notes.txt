When u write ran CAT in the terminal (shell window) the stdout is connected to 
to the terminal, where I can see the output.

process is just a running programm.

---
#stdin - standard input
#stdout - standard output
#stderr - standard error
---

#home directory - the directory where I started when I 1st logged in.
!Recursive delete - to repeatedly delete everything inside <dir>

<b>Globbing</b> - The <u>shell</u> can match simple pattern to FILE and DIRECTOTY names.
* - the glob character, which tells the shell to match ANY NUMBER of arbitrary characters.
e.x. rock@rock:~$ echo Do* 
    >> Documents Downloads
? - the glob character too, instructs the shell to match exactly ONE arbitrary character
e.x. rock@rock:~/looping$ echo ebook?.epub
    >> ebook1.epub ebook2.epub ebook3.epub ebook4.epub ebook5.epub

----
#grep - it's intermediate command and it prints the lines from a file or input stream that match an expression
    for instance, if I want to check every file in /etc that contains the word "root" I can use this command:
    rock@rock:~$ grep root /etc/*
----
standard error - it's an additional output stream for diagnostics and debugging;
    I can redirect the standard error if I like. For example, to send standard output to FILE.txt and standard error
    to ERROR.txt , use the syntex
                2>
        rock@rock:~/looping$ ls ebook1.epub >OUTCOME.txt  2>ERROR.txt // here I'm going to have two files
        rock@rock:~/looping$ ls ebook1.epub  2>ERROR.txt // if no error result would be displayed in stdout (Terminal)
    The number 2 specifies the stream  ID that the shell modifies. Stream ID 1 is stdout (the default), and 2 is standard error.

    <  - standard input Redirection;
    
!I can only access a file in a dir if the dir is executable!

            ## Archiving and Compressing Files ##
gzip - basically takes a file and makes it into a file.gz. The same file was "transformed"/compressed into gz. In order to unzip use command gunzip
tar cvf - "c" stands for Create, "v" - activates verbose diagnostic output; "f" - flag/file option, when we want to create a new archive and add the specific files, for instance
    rock@rock:~/looping$ tar cvf backup.tar *.bak  //create a new archive "backup.tar" and chuck all files which ends up with .bak. At that point all files
                                                  // with extention .bak haven't modified or touched
to unarchive/untar/unpack this file use this command:
    rock@rock:~/looping$ tar xvf backup.tar     // instead of "c" - create, "x" - extract(unpack) an archive.           

Other good thing is before unpacking(extracting) .tar file to check the content of it, or otherwise it's called "table-of-contents" it means using "t" flag instead of the "x"
flag. Having that info I can extract a specific file or directory. 
    rock@rock:~/looping$ tar tvf backup.tar // provides me content of the that archive;

Last thing regarding TAR, when I unpack files it's good to keep a "p" option in order to preserve permissions. Because of it I'm able to override UMASK and get exact permissions specefied 
in the archive.
